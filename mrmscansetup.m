function [T1,T2,R1,R2,Rbin,Nbin] = mrmscansetup(Tzero_ns,R1,R2)
% RDR_SCN_SETUP Function to setup scan times and associated range bins.
%
% Syntax
% [T1,T2,R1,R2,Rbin,Nbin] = rdr_scn_setup(R1,R2)
%
% Input
% R1 - start range (m)
% R2 - stop range (m)
%
% Output
% T1 - start time (ns)
% T2 - stop time (ns)
% R1 - start range (m) [adjusted]
% R2 - stop range (m) [adjusted]
% Rbin - scan range array (m)
% Nbin - number of scan bins
%
% Usage Notes
% R1 will be set as close as possible to the desired value based on timing
% precision in the radio. R2 will be rounded to the next higher possible
% value with the constraint that scans must be a multiple of 96 bins, which
% is equivalent to approximately 0.88 m.
